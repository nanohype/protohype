# marshal

Ceremonial incident commander assistant — P1 war-room assembly, approval-gated Statuspage publish, postmortem draft.

## What This Is

A protohype subsystem composing nanohype templates (`ts-service` worker-service variant, `infra-aws`, `agentic-loop`, `prompt-library`, `module-llm`) into a long-running Slack-socket-mode daemon with a Lambda webhook ingress.

Fork me for a different client by swapping secrets, DynamoDB table names, Slack workspace, Linear project, and Grafana tenant. Port-based DI is load-bearing — every external call goes through a constructor-injected client, not a module import. End-to-end walkthrough in `docs/forking-for-a-new-client.md`.

## How It Works

Grafana OnCall fires a webhook → Lambda verifies HMAC-SHA256, validates Zod schema, idempotently writes to DynamoDB, enqueues to SQS FIFO → ECS Fargate processor picks up the event, dispatches via `EventRegistry` to `WarRoomAssembler` → Slack private channel created, responders invited via parallel WorkOS Directory Sync + Grafana OnCall queries, Grafana Cloud context snapshot attached, checklist pinned, 15-min nudge scheduled via EventBridge Scheduler.

When the IC runs `/marshal resolve`, the `CommandRegistry` dispatches to the resolve handler: generates a postmortem draft via Bedrock (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), creates a Linear issue via `@linear/sdk`, deletes the nudge schedule, posts a 1–5 star pulse rating to the channel, flips the incident status to RESOLVED, and writes `INCIDENT_RESOLVED` + `POSTMORTEM_CREATED` audit events.

Customer-facing Statuspage messages ALWAYS go through the `StatuspageApprovalGate`. The gate writes `STATUSPAGE_DRAFT_APPROVED` to the audit log, then queries the same log with `ConsistentRead: true`, and only then calls `StatuspageClient.createIncident()`. If the audit write or the verify fails, the Statuspage call never happens and the gate throws `AutoPublishNotPermittedError`. CI grep-gate prevents any new call site of `createIncident()` outside the gate file.

## Architecture

- **src/index.ts** — thin wiring layer (<80 LOC). Env validation, dependency construction via `src/wiring/`, command + event registries, Slack app startup, SQS consumer startup, health server, SIGTERM handler.
- **src/wiring/** — `dependencies.ts` constructs all clients/services in one place; `commands.ts` / `events.ts` register handlers. Keeps `index.ts` from becoming a god module.
- **src/handlers/webhook-ingress.ts** — Lambda handler for Grafana OnCall webhooks. HMAC verification with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`. Secret cache keyed on SecretsManager `VersionId`, 5-min TTL, force-refresh on verification failure (rotation race recovery).
- **src/handlers/bedrock-logging-none.ts** — CDK custom resource that sets Bedrock invocation logging to NONE at deploy time. Security requirement: enforced at deploy, not just at call time.
- **src/services/command-registry.ts** — typed slash-command dispatcher. Register handlers via `.register(name, handler)`. Case-insensitive. Unknown subcommand returns "Unknown command" reply.
- **src/services/event-registry.ts** — typed SQS event dispatcher. Unknown event types log a warn and no-op.
- **src/services/war-room-assembler.ts** — assembles the war room (channel → responders → context → checklist → nudge). Parallel responder resolution via `Promise.allSettled`. Non-critical Slack calls wrapped in `withTimeoutOrDefault`.
- **src/services/statuspage-approval-gate.ts** — THE critical module. ONLY code path that calls `StatuspageClient.createIncident()`. Two-phase commit. 100% branch coverage enforced by CI.
- **src/services/nudge-scheduler.ts** — EventBridge Scheduler wrapper. Per-incident schedules. IC silence disables (not deletes) the schedule so audit trail is preserved.
- **src/services/sqs-consumer.ts** — Long-polling SQS consumer. DLQ-safe — no `DeleteMessage` on handler exception. Visibility timeout (300s) drives retry.
- **src/commands/** — one file per `/marshal` subcommand. Each exports a `make<Name>Handler(deps)` factory. `resolve.ts` is the full 9-step resolution (load → commits → Bedrock postmortem → Linear issue → delete nudge → pulse blocks → status flip + audit → public announce → archive channel). Honest-failure paths: if Linear fails, the incident still flips to RESOLVED but the IC reply is explicit about what worked and what didn't.
- **src/events/** — one file per SQS event type.
- **src/actions/register-slack-actions.ts** — Slack Block Kit interactive action bindings (approve, edit, silence, pulse 1–5).
- **src/clients/** — per-service adapters. All use `HttpClient` (5s timeout, 2-retry cap, jittered backoff) except `linear-client` (uses `@linear/sdk` directly, with every SDK call wrapped in `withTimeout(8000ms)` since the SDK has no native deadline).
- **src/ai/marshal-ai.ts** — Bedrock wrapper. System prompts have `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }`. `stripPII` runs BEFORE every Bedrock call. Safe fallback templates for both `generateStatusDraft` and `generatePostmortemSections` if Bedrock fails.
- **src/utils/audit.ts** — All writes AWAITED. ConditionExpression for idempotency. `stringifyError` helper exported so the ternary branch coverage on error-path logging can hit both arms explicitly.
- **src/utils/http-client.ts** — Base HTTP client. Hard-capped timeout (≤5000ms) and retries (≤2). AbortController. Structured log on every retry + timeout.
- **src/utils/metrics.ts** — `MetricsEmitter` over `PutMetricData`. Fire-and-forget. Catches and warns on failure — never throws up to the caller.
- **src/utils/with-timeout.ts** — `withTimeout` (throws on deadline) + `withTimeoutOrDefault` (swallows, returns fallback, warn-logs). Used around non-critical Slack calls.
- **src/utils/env.ts** — `requireEnv(vars)` — fail-fast on missing required env vars.
- **src/utils/logger.ts** — Structured JSON logger to stdout/stderr. `.child({ incident_id })` threads correlation IDs.
- **src/types/** — bounded-context modules (`incident`, `grafana`, `audit`, `statuspage`, `postmortem`, `directory`, `errors`) re-exported through `types/index.ts` as a barrel. Custom error classes (`AutoPublishNotPermittedError`, `DirectoryLookupFailedError`, `ExternalClientTimeoutError`) live in `types/errors.ts`. Directory types (`DirectoryUser`) are IdP-neutral so swapping WorkOS for another provider is a client-file change, not a type surgery.
- **src/utils/incident-lookup.ts** — resolves war-room `channel_id` → canonical `incident_id` via the `slack-channel-index` GSI. Called from `src/index.ts` for every channel-scoped `/marshal` subcommand before dispatch, so handlers receive the real incident ID and slash-command state queries go through a single index-backed lookup rather than a direct PK hit on a guessed ID.
- **infra/lib/marshal-stack.ts** — CDK v2 stack. Two-stack pattern via `namer(env)`. Includes `CfnScheduleGroup` + explicit `processorService.node.addDependency(scheduleGroup)` so the first assembly's nudge-create call never races a not-yet-ready group. See README for the full inventory.
- **test/unit/** — isolated tests: adapters, circuit breaker, audit writer, approval gate, registries, HMAC cache. `audit.test.ts` and `statuspage-approval-gate.test.ts` at 100% branch.
- **test/integration/** — against `amazon/dynamodb-local`. Exercise `ConsistentRead` semantics, idempotency, cross-incident isolation.

```

## Configuration

See README's Configuration table and `docs/secrets.md`. Secrets live in AWS Secrets Manager with separate rotation cadences — the CI inventory-drift gate enforces agreement across `secrets.template.json`, `scripts/seed-secrets.sh`, `scripts/smoke.sh`, and the CDK `importSecretByName` calls. The HMAC cache refreshes on `VersionId` change, so rotating the Grafana OnCall webhook HMAC secret does not require a Lambda redeploy. Other secrets (Slack, Linear, Grafana, Statuspage, WorkOS) are pulled at ECS task start — after rotation, force a new deployment so the running task picks up the new value.

## Conventions

Project conventions (Node 24, ESM `.js` suffixes, strict TS with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, Zod at boundaries, structured JSON logging) come from root `protohype/CLAUDE.md`.

Marshal-specific:

- **Audit writes are awaited.** `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises: error` enforces this. A fire-and-forget audit write is a security bug, not a style issue.
- **Slack calls have explicit deadlines.** WebClient-level `timeout: 10000` plus per-call `withTimeout` / `withTimeoutOrDefault` for non-critical paths. Assembly must complete in ≤5 min SLO and cannot be hostage to a single wedged call.
- **Silent stubs are bugs.** If a command doesn't drive its action through, it says so to the IC. Never reply "triggered" for work that didn't happen.
- **Metrics are best-effort.** `MetricsEmitter` swallows errors. Operational visibility degrades; incident handling doesn't.
- **Registry pattern for dispatch.** New slash command = one file in `src/commands/`, one `.register()` line in `src/wiring/commands.ts`. Never grow a `switch` in `index.ts`.
- **Port-based DI for subsystem reuse.** Every external service accessed through a constructor-injected client. Forking marshal for a new client means swapping the client instance, not touching business logic.

## Testing

### Test matrix

| Tier | Files | What they exercise |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Static | `tsconfig.json` strict + `eslint.config.mjs` + `.prettierrc.json` | Types, lint rules (no floating promises, no-explicit-any, no-console), consistent format |
| Unit | `test/unit/*.test.ts` | Pure functions, mocked SDKs, handler flows, adapter fail modes |
| Integration | `test/integration/*.integration.test.ts` | Real dynamodb-local — `ConsistentRead`, idempotency, cross-incident isolation |
| E2E (scripted) | `scripts/fire-drill.sh`, `scripts/ci-drill.sh` | Full webhook → SQS → processor → Slack → DDB path, in a live staging stack |
| E2E (manual) | `artifacts/incident-drill-playbook.md` | Tabletop + live-fire drills against real Grafana OnCall routing |

### Coverage

- 100% branch on `src/utils/audit.ts` and `src/services/statuspage-approval-gate.ts`. CI fails on regression.
- Global 55% branches / 75% statements / 75% lines / 75% functions. These are honest thresholds — if a future PR lowers coverage, CI goes red.
- Regression experiment proves enforcement is live: flipping `ConsistentRead: true` → `false` in `audit.ts` makes `npm run test:unit` exit 1. See README for the procedure.

### Adding tests

- Security-critical changes go in the 100%-threshold files. Every new branch needs both sides covered.
- Dispatch-layer changes (new command, new event) get a handler-level unit test plus an entry in the relevant registry test.
- Anything that depends on DynamoDB semantics (consistency, conditions, GSI) → integration test, not unit.
