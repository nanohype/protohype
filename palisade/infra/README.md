# palisade-infra

AWS CDK stack for palisade

## Architecture

This project deploys an AI service infrastructure on AWS using CDK with the following components:

- **Compute:** ecs — Lambda function with API Gateway or ECS Fargate service with Application Load Balancer
- **Region:** us-west-2
- **VPC:** Networking with public/private subnets, NAT gateway, and VPC endpoints (when enabled)
- **Database:** RDS PostgreSQL with Secrets Manager credential management (when enabled)
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboard, metric alarms, and SNS notifications (when enabled)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials
- [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html) (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)

## Getting Started

### Bootstrap CDK (first time only)

```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT_ID/us-west-2
```

### Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Customization

### Compute Target

This project was generated with the `ecs` compute target. The active target's constructs are imported via `lib/constructs/compute/ecs` and `lib/constructs/api/ecs`. To use the alternate target, update the import paths in `lib/stack.ts` and `lib/constructs/monitoring.ts`.

- For ECS, add a `Dockerfile` at the project root
- For Lambda, implement your handler in `lambda/handler.ts`

### Adding Resources

Create new constructs in `lib/constructs/` and wire them into `lib/stack.ts`. Follow the existing pattern of typed props and conditional instantiation.

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Use CDK context values or environment variables to customize per-environment settings. See the [CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/context.html) for details.
